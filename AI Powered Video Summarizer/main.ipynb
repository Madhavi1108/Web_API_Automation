Just now, a mother bird brought back some food to feed baby birds. But two baby birds were competing for food. Then, the mother bird flew away and took the food away from them. They were then stunned for one or two minutes. They didn't move at all. Quiet, everyone. Sang Zhi. Pay attention and look at the blackboard. Sit down. Let's read the third question aloud. A triangle ABC with side lengths of 5 cm, 13 cm, and 12 cm. Obviously, we can see that the longest length is C. So, how do we get this? The condition is given that side length is A.

I'm sorry about earlier today. I pointed to the wrong line and got you caught by the teacher again. Your mother has already come here twice in just half a month. I'm clueless how I have irritated him. But when you directed his question back to him, I felt like punching you, let alone Chen. Don't you think his voice sounds hypnotic? I would've fallen asleep if I hadn't found something else to do. You're right. But why do you always get caught by him? It never happens to me, though. Are you going to the bookstore? Why? Fu Zhengchu invited us. And also some boys from his class. Let's go together. Why do you want to go there? To buy some reference books. Are you coming along? No. So, are you coming or not? No, I'm not going. But they're waiting over there. Let's go, please. Go ahead if you want. I'm not in the mood today. Because your parents are asked to come over? What do you plan to do? They're not coming. Even so, Mr. Chen will phone them anyway. So, I asked my brother to come over. I'm leaving. Sang Zhi. Bye-bye. Sang Zhi, why are you leaving? Sang Zhi. I thought we were going to the bookstore. Is Sang Zhi not coming with us? The teacher scolded her. She's down. So her parents have to come here again? Her parent comes more frequently than yours, Fu Zhengchu. Shame on you. Mind your business. Why doesn't he help me? How am I going to face Dad and Mom? Just you wait. Silly Dog. What should I do? Doggy. Come here. You're so adorable. I tell you what, Sang Yan, that silly dog, left me to struggle myself, and he even angered me. You think he's hateful, right? Let me tell you this. You mustn't grow into a big silly dog like him in the future. Though you're now a small silly dog, please don't be silly like him when you grow up, okay? You're good in this way. Even you get me angry, huh? Are you making me angry too? I'm sure you'll become a big silly dog like Sang Yan afterward. Zhi, welcome back. Mom. Erm... Hold on. Take the fruit upstairs. Yan is back. Yan is back? Yes. Be careful when you go upstairs. -Okay.\n",

If you hadn't,\n",

My roommate, Duan Jiaxu. Hello, little girl. I'm Duan Jiaxu. Your brother's friend. Do we look alike? The bathroom is over there. Do you want to look in the mirror? I don't look like you at all. Really? But your sister asked me if I got plastic surgery just now. What do you mean? Yan. Didn't you say that you weren't coming back today? Little demon. Don't tell me you mistook him for me. And worst, the tweaked version of me. Little demon. What are you thinking about every day? What's on your mind? You... Stop! Isn't it natural for you\n",

Moreover, there was only one person in the room. Naturally, I mistook him for you! Keep it down! Why should I? Too loud! You can't beat me. Here. Have some fruit. Don't bother with him. Duan Jiaxu. Do you want to take a shower before we go? No. Go and get changed now. We're leaving. All right. I'm going to get changed. -Hurry up.\n",
            "-Wait! Yan. I... I need your help. Move away. I have an appointment for plastic surgery later. My bad. No way. Are you leaving me to die? I don't even know what you're asking for. Fire away. What's it? Please say yes first. I can't do that. Are you going to report me to Mom? Mom. Mom. Mommy. Mommy. You were laughing just now. What has happened? Mom, Yan beat me. Mom. Mom, Yan beat me. Sang Yan. Can you not bully your sister? Mom. Stop that. Why shush her? How dare you bully her! Mom. Yan beat me. He said I... All right, dear. There, there. How could you do that to her? I'm going to teach him a lesson. Come with me. What was going on? I didn't touch her. You... You said you didn't touch her? I saw that with my eyes. Duan is still here. How could you do that to your sister? I won't do it again. You should know you're a big brother. Never again. Not anymore. Fine, it's good that you know you're wrong. Can you get me a tissue paper? Does this happen to you two often? It's nothing. Don't worry. Mom didn't mean that. We've been like this since we were little. Didn't you ask Yan for his help just now? Why did you frame him, then? Wait, little girl. Hold back your tears. What about this? I... I'll talk to Yan and ask him to help you. What kind of help do you need? It won't work. He won't help me. No, he won't. Yan isn't that petty. Jiaxu. Do you have time tomorrow? Tomorrow? Yes, tomorrow. What if I say I don't have time. No, you can't. You have to be available. Why? Hadn't you told Yan about the plastic surgery thing, I wouldn't have fought with him, and he wouldn't have turned me down. You have a point. So, tell me. What do you need me to do? Can you please pretend to be my brother? Biological brother. And... meet with my teacher. Your parents are asked\n",
            "to meet the teacher at school? What have you done? Can I not tell? Sure, you can. Well, I don't have time tomorrow. I wasn't paying attention during class. I got called to answer questions. I answered that correctly. But he later said he wanted to meet with my parent. Do you expect me to buy that? I'm telling the truth. If you don't believe me, you'll find out tomorrow when you go there. Even if I lie to you now, the teacher will tell you everything tomorrow. True. Little demon. Get out. Can't I stay? I'm changing my clothes. Didn't you say you'd change it outside? I want to change it here. If so, he should leave the room too. I don't think he enjoys watching you get changed. You two, get out. I'm going to undress. Took you long enough. Close the door. Hey. Are you coming or not tomorrow? I've told you everything. Why don't you seek Yan? No way. I framed him just now. If I were to tell him... Yan isn't like that. What are you mumbling again? Little demon. Oh, a light bulb burned out. Mrs. Sang. I'll get going. You're leaving? Are you not staying for dinner? I've prepared many dishes. I have a part-time job later. Please enjoy the meal without me. All right. What about you, Yan? I'm not eating since he's not. Fine. Take the trash out for me. Take the paper boxes out first. Hurry up. I'll do it, Mrs. Sang. No. Don't bother. I... It's just a small deal. I'm leaving. All right, thank you. Come for dinner next time. Sure, Mrs. Sang. Good. I'll take my leave, Mrs. Sang.\n",

Are you trying to say that I'm too short to be in Grade 8? Rightfully so. That's what he meant. No, I didn't, little girl. Don't mistake me. I won't argue with you on this. Anyway, I'll grow taller. No worries at all. You're not growing again. But it's good for you, though. People will think that you're 18 even when you're at your 30.

When was the last time you were back? You can ask Dad and Mom if they still recognize you. I haven't seen you for a month, and you're giving me this attitude? What attitude do you expect from me, then? Welcome. A warm welcome to you. Welcome home, Yan. Are you happy? Is this okay? Happy. Let me give you a big hand. Well, stop it. Enough. That's enough.

Get off me. You guys talk. I'm leaving. Zhi. If you like the doll, take it with you. Bye. Duan Jiaxu hasn't thrown that away. What's wrong with him? It's just a decoration on his bed. It's completely useless. By the way, Qian Fei, does Jiaxu have a girlfriend? Did his girlfriend give him this? He doesn't have a girlfriend. He's busy every day and has no time for that.

Me either. Why are you back? I've brought some food for you. Help yourselves. Okay. Sure. It's all your fault. If you didn't always bring food back from work, I wouldn't be so chubby now. You're to blame. Xu. My sister phoned me just now, saying that you have something with her. She has my thing? Hold on. I'll call her. Did you find the thing? Kiddo. What did I leave behind with you? No, it's not your thing. I have left something at your place. What's it? An exercise book. I'll ask Yan to send it to you tomorrow morning. But I haven't started writing it. Are you asking me to do it for you? No. Because it's a composition. I might not have time to finish it. Why don't you ask Yan to do it for you? He'll break my leg. Sang Zhi.
